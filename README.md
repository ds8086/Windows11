# Windows 11
You thought Vista was bad?! Buckle up buttercup, you've never been *less* in control of what your operating system is doing than with Windows 11.
Back in the day, we all turned to [Black Viper](https://www.blackviper.com/) for Windows tuning tips, this repo is an homage to that lost art.

# Mission
Settings will be configured via local GPO whenever possible. I feel these changes have the best chance of surviving revert via a patch.
What cannot be configured via local GPO, will be set via registry. Native PowerShell cmdlets will be used for app removal and the like.

# FAQs
Q: What if I like Windows 11 the way it is?
A: This is not the repo you are looking for.

Q: Should I use this in my corporate network?
A: Probably not, but I'm not your supervisor.
